The net_client.py and net_server.py program run together to send messages between each other. net_client.py asks the user for a message they would like to send to the net_server.py program. Once the net_server.py program accepts the connection it receives the message and sends back a new message to the client side. The message describes how many words were sent to the server. The program will continue running until the client decides to close the program, which can be done by typing "n" when it asks the user if they would like to continue sending messages.
